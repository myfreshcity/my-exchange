# Applications - Trade
Matching engine and the core of the BitEx platform

# Applications - Ws Gateway
The HTTP/WebSocket gateway is based on Tornado.  It relays HTTP or websocket API
requests to the trade engine in order to place orders or fetching market data.

# Applications - Mailer
The mailing application... sends mail. To that end, 
it uses Mailchimp's transaction email solution, Mandrill.

E-mail templates are stored under the templates/ dir,
and which template to use (and the data to fill it out)
are supplied by listening on the zeromq socket.

```
cd ./jsdev/tools
$ python extract_messages.py  > /tmp/file_to_be_translated.xml

# translate the xml
$ cp /tmp/file_to_be_translated.xml  ./jsdev/translations/pt_BR.xtb

# edit the build_release.sh to include the translated version.
$ vi ./jsdev/build_release.sh

$ ./jsdev/build_release.sh  # recompile the application using the translated file

# translated the html static page
# vi ./static/statoshi_square.html
```

#Why the name of the folder is Bitex ?

Bitex stands for Bitcoin EXchange and it was the first that we came up it name of our platform, by mid 2014 a company called bitex.la was formed in Argentina and we were forced to change our name, this source code it is not related in any form to bitex.la.
